# yii2-relation-trait

#### I am not the creator of this extension, I have made a bug fix and made a pull request. I am just publishing this for my own usage. Feel free to use it.

#### All thanks to @mootensai for creating the extension.

#### This is not to replace the package maintained by @mootensai

Yii 2 Models add functionality for load with relation (loadAll($POST)), &amp; transactional save with relation (saveAll())

PLUS soft delete/restore feature!

Best work with [mootensai/yii2-enhanced-gii](https://github.com/mootensai/yii2-enhanced-gii)

## Installation

The preferred way to install this extension is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/).

Either run

```bash
$ composer require 'deadmantfa/yii2-relation-trait:dev-master'
```

or add

```
"deadmantfa/yii2-relation-trait": "*"
```

to the `require` section of your `composer.json` file.


## Usage At Model

```php
class MyModel extends ActiveRecord{
    use \deadmantfa\relation\RelationTrait;
}
```

## Array Input & Usage At Controller

It takes a normal array of POST. This is the example
```php
Array (
    $_POST['ParentClass'] => Array 
        (
            [attr1] => value1
            [attr2] => value2 
            // has many
            [relationName] => Array 
                ( 
                    [0] => Array 
                        (
                            [relAttr] => relValue1
                        )
                    [1] => Array 
                        (
                            [relAttr] => relValue1
                        )
                )
            // has one
            [relationName] => Array
                ( 
                    [relAttr1] => relValue1
                    [relAttr2] => relValue2
                )
        )
)

OR

Array (
    $_POST['ParentClass'] => ['attr1' => 'value1','attr2' => 'value2'],
    // Has One
    $_POST['RelatedClass'] => ['relAttr1' => 'value1','relAttr2' => 'value2'], 
    // Has Many
    $_POST['RelatedClass'] => Array
        (
            [0] => Array
                (
                    [attr1] => value1
                    [attr2] => value2
                )
            [1] => Array
                (
                    [attr1] => value1
                    [attr2] => value2
                )
        )      
)
```

```php
// sample at controller
if($model->loadAll(Yii:$app->request->post()) && $model->saveAll()){
    return $this->redirect(['view', 'id' => $model->id, 'created' => $model->created]);
}
```

# Features

## Array Output  

```php
// I use this to send model & related through JSON / Serialize
print_r($model->getAttributesWithRelatedAsPost());
```

```
Array
(
    [MainClass] => Array
        (
            [attr1] => value1
            [attr2] => value2
        )

    [RelatedClass] => Array
        (
            [0] => Array
                (
                    [attr1] => value1
                    [attr2] => value2
                )
        )

)
```

```php
print_r($model->getAttributesWithRelated());
```

```
Array
(
    [attr1] => value1
    [attr2] => value2
    [relationName] => Array
        (
            [0] => Array
                (
                    [attr1] => value1
                    [attr2] => value2
                )
        )
)
```

## Use Transaction

So your data will be atomic
(see : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)

## Use Normal Save

So your behaviors still works

## Add Validation At Main Model

```php
$form->errorSummary($model);
```

will give you

```
<<Related Class Name>> #<<index + 1>> : <<error message>>
My Related Model #1 : Attribute is required
```

## It Works On Auto Incremental PK Or Not (I Have Tried Use UUID)

See here if you want to use my behavior :

https://github.com/mootensai/yii2-uuid-behavior

## Soft Delete

Add this line to your Model to enable soft delete

```php
private $_rt_softdelete;

function __construct(){
    $this->_rt_softdelete = [
        '<column>' => <undeleted row marker value>
        // multiple row marker column example
        'isdeleted' => 1,
        'deleted_by' => \Yii::$app->user->id,
        'deleted_at' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s')
    ];
}
```

Add this line to your Model to enable soft restore

```php
private $_rt_softrestore;

function __construct(){
    $this->_rt_softrestore = [
        '<column>' => <undeleted row marker value>
        // multiple row marker column example
        'isdeleted' => 0,
        'deleted_by' => 0,
        'deleted_at' => 'NULL'
    ];
}
```

### Should work on Yii's supported DB

It use all Yii's Active Query or Active Record to execute DB command


### I'm open for any improvement
Please create issue if you got a problem or an idea for enhancement
